## Required prework
During this workshop, you will be writing python code on your own laptop to analyze a provided sample data set. Working on your own laptop means you will walk away from the workshop ready to continue learning Python and using it with your own resaerch data! To make this possible, I ask that you do some setup on your laptop before arriving.

### I have used Python on my laptop before

### This is all totally new to me

This workshop is a quick 90 minute workshop. To get the most out of it, please come with your laptop already configured.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RebeccaWPerry/python_data_wrangling/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
