# Data Wrangling with Python

## Required prework
During this workshop, you will be writing python code on your own laptop to analyze a provided sample data set. Working on your own laptop means you will walk away from the workshop ready to continue learning Python and using it with your own research data! To make this possible, I ask that you do some setup on your laptop before arriving.

Here are separate instructions for those who have used Python before and for newbies: 





### This is all new to me


### I already have Python on my computer
Great -- let's check that you have interactive Python and a few really helpful libraries. For this workshop, we will be using an interactive python console. If you are a big fan of iPython notebooks, you may use those instead of the console but there will not be support to troubleshoot the notebooks.

1. Open a terminal (linux/apple) or command prompt (windows) and type ipython followed by enter.
```markdown
ipython
```
If you see a Python version number, an iPython version number, and get a new prompt strting with "In [1]:", then you have interactive Python! If you see an error instead of these things, then you will need to install interactive python. I reccomend going back to "This is all new to me," but you can also forge ahead by installing iPython on its own (https://ipython.org/install.html)

2. Now check for packages that we will use in class by typing these lines followed by enter after each line.
```markdown
import time
import glob
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
If these packages are already installed, then the ipython console will simply return new input lines. If you are missing any of these libraries, you will see a message like "ImportError: No module named matplotlib." If that is the case, you can try installing the missing packages individually (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) or go back to This is all new to me.

3. Great! You know how to start up an interactive python console and can import the necessary libraries. Please bring this laptop to the workshop. See you there!


This workshop is a quick 90 minute workshop. To get the most out of it, please come with your laptop already configured.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RebeccaWPerry/python_data_wrangling/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
